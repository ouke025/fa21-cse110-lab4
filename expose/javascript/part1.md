1. Line 9 prints: "values added: 20".
2. Line 13 prints: "final result: 20".
3. Line 9 prints: "values added: 20".
4. Line 13 prints an error: "ReferenceError: result is not defined". This is because result is defined with the "let" keyword so that it can only be accessed within the if statement.
5. The code returns an error at line 7 because because it is attempting to modify "result" which is defined as a constant.
6. Line 13 would print an error similar to question 4 if the program falls through line 7. This is because result is defined with the "const" keyword so that it can only be accessed within the if statement.
